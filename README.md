# MonthlyPaymentsKeeperApp#

* This project was created as an exercise during React course.
* The idea of write an app like this was taken from a "Complete React Developer Course".
* All code with comments have written by my own with an understanding of its work.
* Styling of background comes form https://unsplash.com.
* MonthlyPaymentsKeeperApp has written in JS libraby - React with Redux, Babel, Webpack, Firebase, Node-sass, Airbnb 
and all needed plugins/tools which you can find in the project.
* The app is styled in SASSheroku open and tested in Jest. 
* MonthlyPaymentsKeeperApp is a tool to save and rewrite your invoices keeping in one place.
* The user connects with google Firebse via a gmail account and passes through verify Firebase authorisation which allows him to
access only to his own database/ list of saved data.     
* Additionally the project was divided to production and developer mode avoids a need to download all unnecessary data using to develop the app. 

#To run the app make steps as below#

* clone the repository
* run npm/yarn install
* run npm start (npm start server) or
* npm run dev-server
* visit localhost:3000
* ex.path(/desktop/MonthlyPaymentsKeeperApp/npm start)
